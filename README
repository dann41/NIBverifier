# NIBVerifier
This application aims to be used to validate Portuguese bank accounts (NIB).

## From GUI
When no arguments passed to the program, the application launches a GUI to input the NIB and check if its valid.

## From command line
You can also use it form the command line. You just need to pass as many NIB as you want to validate.
